  - Great for list performance: https://github.com/Flipkart/recyclerlistview.\
  **Why recycler list view is better than Flatlist**
  * Let look into how Flatlist work, it mount every list item in viewport and unmount other items, when screen is scrolled, other items is mount, that's why screen will appear some blank view when scroll in fast speed. 
  * With Recycler list view, instead of un-mounting it reclaim views outside of viewport to render new items. This prevents view creation which is expensive and keeps memory usage finite.
